The Legend Of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 Autosplitter / Load Remover

A load remover for The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 that includes the option to split on battle ends (and possibly more places in the future).

The load remover works by reading from the game's logfile in %temp%, while the split part works through a pointer path to the game's memory.

Installation should be done through Livesplit preferably.

Special thanks to Xorhash, for the log file monitor (even though Windows proved to make reading a file with precision way too hard, much to our disappointment), and Durante, for accomodating us and adding loading markers to the log file upon our request. Also to my boy 56 for putting up with my ranting about how coding sucks and suggesting how to make my code not horrible.
